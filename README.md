### Efficient Data Transformation and Preparation with Power Query

  In this project, I've utilized Power Query to efficiently transform and prepare our data. With Power Query's powerful toolkit, I've conducted various actions, including data cleaning, creating new measures, and optimizing the dataset.
  
- Data cleaning has been crucial to ensure the quality and consistency of our information. By employing data cleaning techniques such as removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats, I've ensured that our data is free from inconsistencies and suitable for analysis.
  
- Furthermore, I've leveraged Power Query to create new measures that enable us to gain even deeper insights from our data. These customized measures have provided us with additional metrics and enriched our understanding of the information.
  
- Lastly, I've optimized the data preparation process to ensure its efficiency and speed. By eliminating unnecessary steps and applying optimization techniques, I've streamlined the workflow and achieved faster results.
